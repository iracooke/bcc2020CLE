# Command line essentials for Bioinformatians

This website is a companion reference for the corresponding [BCC2020 conference session](https://sched.co/c7Sz). 

## How to use this site

The workshop exercises on this site assume that you have basic familiarity with the unix shell.  In case you need a quick refresher, we start the workshop with [this presentation](https://rpubs.com/iracooke/bcc2020cle) which outlines why command line skills are important and runs through the key features of the Bash shell.

## Setup

#### If you are a BCC2020 workshop participant

1. Log in to the workshop server using the credentials provided by your instructor.  
The workshop server is available at [rstudio.bioinformatics.guide](https://rstudio.bioinformatics.guide)
2. The server is running rstudio but for this workshop we will just use the `Terminal` feature provided by rstudio.  Click `Tools` -> `Terminal` -> `New Terminal`.  

#### If you want to run the exercises on your own computer

1. Open a Terminal window on your computer. 
2. Create a directory for workshop materials
```bash
mkdir bcc2020cle
```
3. Download and run the setup script
```bash
cd bcc2020cle
wget ...
bash setup.sh
```
