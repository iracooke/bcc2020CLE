# Exercise 2

In this exercise we will perform a very basic functional annotation on a list of unknown proteins. We will do this by running a blast search against uniprot.  We will then use a combination of tools to generate a new protein fasta file that contains the functional information.


## Inputs

- A list of protein sequences.
- The Uniprot database, pre-indexed for blast searching

## Tasks

1. Extract the first 100 sequences from the H_mac_protein.fasta file
2. Blast the sequences against Uniprot
3. Join the blast results back into the fasta file
