# Exercise 4

In this exercise we will attempt to design probes for a random subset of variant loci in a genome

## Inputs

- A large vcf file containing all variant sites
- The corresponding genome sequence

## Tasks

1. Filter the variants according to some basic criteria
2. Extract a random subset of the filtered variant sites
3. Extract a small flanking region around the variant sites and write this to a fasta file
